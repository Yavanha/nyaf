# What is Storybook?

Creating an app can be hard if there is no structure. Storybook solves this by providing a graphical view on the component structure.

> **Storybook about itself:**: Storybook is a user interface development environment and playground for UI components. The tool enables developers to create components independently and showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment.

Apart from all the other frameworks Storybook supports, there is a plugin that supports **ny@f** very well.
